    <h1>What I have learned so far<h1/>
  
<b>The Internet<b/>
  
<p>The internet is basically just computers talking to each other. Say you go to <a href="https://www.nhl.com">here</a> to check the scores for the NHL playoffs. Your computer will send a request to a server and it will find the right http.<p/>

<b>Tags and Elements</b>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When
  writing HTML, the programer will tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>. Some examaples are <em>italicize</em>, <b>bold<b/> 
</p>

<b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
<p>Computers are stupid because they follow direction too well. If you forget an <em>entag on something, it could mess up the whole document.
</p>

<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form almost a empty white space around the element.
